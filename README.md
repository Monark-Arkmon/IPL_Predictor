# IPL Match Predictor

**90.9% accurate** machine learning system for IPL match prediction using ensemble modeling and advanced feature engineering.

## Key Achievements

**90.9% Prediction Accuracy** - Ensemble of XGBoost + Neural Network  
**+22.1pp Performance Gain** - Enhanced from 55% baseline to 77% through feature engineering  
**260K+ Records Processed** - Complete IPL dataset (2008-2024) with automated validation  
**86 Engineered Features** - Team composition, player stats, venue analysis, tournament context

## Quick Start

```bash
# Train models
python train.py

# Make predictions
python predict.py "Mumbai Indians" "Chennai Super Kings" "Wankhede Stadium"
python predict.py "GT" "RR" "Narendra Modi Stadium" --toss-winner "GT" --toss-decision "bat"
```
